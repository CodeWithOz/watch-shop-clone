# Watch Shop Clone
A clone of the landing page of the website whose designs are available [on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/n9mXnXnj9gwp17dAv4SZsl/Watch-Shop-London-UI?node-id=0%3A1). Built with SvelteKit.

## Notes
- The font used in the Figma designs is Bilo, a [paid](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bilo) font, so I used a Google's Roboto as the main font with `sans-serif` as the fallback.

## Local Development
- clone the repo
- install dependencies using `pnpm` (or `npm` if you prefer, but my lockfile is for pnpm)
- start the dev server using `pnpm run dev -- --open`
